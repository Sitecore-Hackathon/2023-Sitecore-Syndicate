## Description

  - One sunny thirsday afternoon you just got back from the coffee shop and get a call from a very rich multi national client who wants a demo of sitecore for their art gallery. They want to digitize, showcase, personalize, and sell art online. They are ready to spend all the money they made from selling NFTs over the last couple of years. AND the kicker is they want a demo tomorrow. 
  - Good thing you have some docker knowledge but speaking from experience, that's not a one day task. So you will always head to Sitecore Demo Portal. 
  - Second problem is what do you demo with. You need data. You never worked for a client who sells art. You need art and it's not enough time to get budget approved for downlaoding abstract art from Shutterstock. The designer has taken tomorrow off. Your artist daughter could help you gather media  but she gets minor panic attack every time she hears the word 'Sitecore'.
  - We have solved this problem for you with this submission.
    - Install the package
    - right click on a folder
    - Fill in what you want a picture of
    - How many images do you want
    - and the size (large, medium or small)
    - Drink your coffee and watch powershell takes over and generate all these items for you
